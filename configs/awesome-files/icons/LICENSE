Brightness, touch, blank, powersave and blue icons were created by M. Fauvell (elsenyordelcaos)

The other icons were modifications of Thayer's icons of dzen wiki 
(http://dzen.geekmode.org/wiki/wiki.cgi/-main/DzenIconPacks) 
with new icons derived created by me.

I could not find any licensing informationattached to those original bitmaps.
