      <h1>Change log</h1>

      <p>If you create a user account on the Website, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur
      under the account and any other actions taken in connection with the account. You must not describe or assign keywords to your account, project or repository in a misleading
      or unlawful manner, including in a manner intended to trade on the name or reputation of others. Gitorious may change or remove any description or keyword that it considers
      inappropriate or unlawful, or otherwise likely to cause Gitorious liability. You must immediately notify Gitorious of any unauthorized uses of your project, your repository,
      your account or any other breaches of security. Gitorious will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such
      acts or omissions.</p>

      <h2>Responsibility of Contributors.</h2>

      <p>If you operate a project and/or repository, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, post comments on the Website, or otherwise make (or allow any third
      party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the Content, and any liability resulting from the
      Content, its use or distribution. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, audio files, or computer software. By making
      Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>the downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary or intellectual property rights, including the copyright, patent right, trademark or
        trade secret, of any third party;</li>

        <li>if your employer or others has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from such person to post or make available the
        Content, including any software, or (ii) secured from your such person a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>

        <li>you have fully complied to any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required
        terms;</li>

        <li>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive Content;</li>

        <li>the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated with malicious intent towards the Website, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial Content
        designed to drive traffic to third party internet sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or commit or contribute to further unlawful acts (such as
        phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>

        <li>the Content is not defamatory, does not contain threats or incite violence towards individuals or entities, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any
        third party;</li>

        <li>your account, project or repository is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, blogs and web sites, and
        similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>

        <li>your account, project or repository is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your
        account’s, project’s or repository’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company other than your own; and</li>

        <li>you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the type, nature, uses and effects of the Content, whether
        requested to do so by Gitorious or otherwise.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As a contributor you shall ensure that the license under which
        you distribute the Content entitles Gitorious to reproduce and
        publish the Content as you submit it to Gitorious, or
        otherwise indemnify Gitorious against any claims or damages
        awarded due to claims of infringement.
        By submitting Content to Gitorious, you are responsible for
        ensuring that such creations do not violate the licensor’s
        or any third party's license right, property or intellectual
        property rights.
        Authors of derived work are responsible for ensuring that the
        derived Content conforms to the original Content's license(s),
        regardless of where the original Content is hosted.
      </p>

      <p>
        To the extent any Content you contribute requires a patent
        license to be used, modified, sub-licensed or otherwise for
        the exercise of rights granted in the applicable license, such
        patent license shall hereby be deemed as granted by you to
        users downloading the Content, to the extent you possess such
        patent rights or right to grant patent license.
      </p>

      <p>
        When deleting Content, Gitorious will use reasonable efforts
        to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that due to
        caching or references the Content may not be made unavailable
        immediately or at all.
      </p>
